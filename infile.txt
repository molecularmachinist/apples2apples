# Input file example.
# The symbol # is used for comment lines.
# The first non-empty line after these comments includes column titles.
# The columns are separated from eachother by pipe symbol |.
# The columns input_pdbs, first_residue_index and output_ndx
# are required. In the input_pdbs at least 2 pdb files are required.
# If selections are not given, they are assumed to be "all".
# See  https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/selections.html
# for syntax of the selections column.
# The columns output_ndx and output_pdb are to specify output files in alignment,
# while the former is used as input in fitting.
# Note that the pipe symbols don't have to be aligned.
# The below line marks which columns are used by which command, a=align and f=fit.
# Added asterisk means its required for that command
