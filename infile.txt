# Input file format example.
# The symbol # is used for comment lines.
# The first non-empty line after these comments includes column titles. 
# The columns are separated from eats other by symbol |.
# The columns input_pdbs, selections, first_residue_index and either output_ndx or output_pdb
# are required. In the input_pdbs at least 2 pdb files are required.
# See  https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/selections.html 
# for syntax of the selections column. The first_residue_index column contains
# the residue index used in the pdb file of corresponding line. 
# The columns output_ndx and output_pdb are to spedicy output files
